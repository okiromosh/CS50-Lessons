A way for django to remember which client is which
    and store data about a particular session

In app-name views.py
        def index(request):
            # to create data for individual sessions
            if "tasks" not in request.session:
                # if this session doesnt have a tasks variable
                # create a new list [] for it
                request.session["tasks"] = []

            return render(request, "tasks/index.html", {
                "tasks": request.session["tasks"]
            })



To give django access to the created session table
In Terminal
        >python manage.py migrate


Sessions are determined by cookies
